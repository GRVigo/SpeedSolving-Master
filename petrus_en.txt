Petrus method

	The first block is searched for each possible orientations of the cube, using at most the
	number of moves specified for the first block (search depth). If this parameter is very 
	low (less than 6) you will hardly find solutions. With a value of 6 or 7, results should
	already appear, and with 8, a result should appear for each orientation. The solution for
	the first block is taken among all possible ones by evaluating its number of movements, but
	also taking into account that the arrangement of the pieces to expand the block is as 
	favorable as possible.

	The search for the expanded block will be done in a similar way. Then the edges orientation
	will be performed.

	The next step is to complete the first two layers (F2L), you can specify his own search depth.

	Finally the last layer will be solved using ZBLL, COLL+EPLL or OCLL+PLL algorithms. These 
	algorithms are predefined and their search is very fast.
