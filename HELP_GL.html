<h3>Start &#38; Skip buttons</h3>
The start button launches a search. If a search step last too much, you can press the skip button and the search will advance immediately to the next step of the method.
<br><br>
The Skip button is not available in LBL method.
<h3>Cache</h3>
If
you enable the cache, the first step of the selected method (cross for
CFOP, first block for Roux, etc.) will be calculated 10-15% slower, as
a generic search will be done and it will be stored in memory. If you
perform a new search changing the method or sub-method, but you use the
same scramble and the same or lower speed, it will be much faster, as
the first step, usually the longer, will be taken from cache. This is
very useful if you want to analyze the same scramble using different
methods.<br>
<br>
If cache is disabled, each search will always perform all the steps.<br>
<br>
So,
if you plan to analyze the same scramble several times with a slow o
very slow speed, enable cache. If you plan to evaluate a new scramble
each time, or you have a fast or medium speed, disable it.<br>
<br>
Please note that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cache
can require a high use of memory</span>.<br>
<h3>Cores</h3>
This
parameter specifies the amount of CPU cores (threads) used in the
search. A zero value means all available cores will be used.<br>
<h3>Scramble</h3>
You can write here your own scramble. With the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Random</span>
button you can generate a random scramble of the specified length. You
also can copy and paste scrambles from your favorite scramble
generator.<br>
<br>
Next to the scramble an <span style="font-weight: bold;">evaluation</span>
is showed. This is an experimental feature and gives you an idea of how
difficult the solve will be. Evaluation depends on the orientation. If
all orientations are selected, the evaluation will be the average of
the evaluations of all the orientations. If you plan to solve the
scramble in a specific orientation, select it to get his evaluation.<br>
<h3>Method, Variant and Option</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Layer_by_layer">Layer
by layer</a></h4>
The Layer by layer method or beginners method is based on
solving the
layers of the cube one by one. The first layer is solved in two steps:
first the cross, indicating the movements needed to solve each<br>
edge, and then the corners, one by one.<br>
<br>
For the second layer, the movements required to complete each of its
edges are shown.<br>
<br>
The
last layer is solved in four steps: orientation of the cross,
permutation of the cross, corners permutation and, finally, corners
orientation. Each step uses only one algorithm (shown in
parentheses each time it appears).<br>
<br>
Speed, amount of solves, regrips and cancellations don't affect to this
method.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP_method">CFOP</a></h4>
The
cross is searched on each of the specified orientations, chosen among
all the possible ones evaluating its number of movements, but also
taking into account that the arrangement of the pieces for F2L is as
favorable as possible.<br>
<br>
The first two layers (F2L) search is fast,
about 2 or 3 seconds per inspection on a modern processor, and it will
try to get the shortest possible solution for each solve.<br>
<br>
The
next step is to get the appropriate algorithms for OLL and PLL. These
algorithms are predefined and their search is very fast. It is also
possible to complete the last layer in a single algorithm (1LLL), or
even with edges orientation and ZBLL algorithms (EO+ZBLL) -edges
orientation search lasts a bit more time-.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Roux_method">Roux</a></h4>
The
first block is searched for each possible orientations of the cube and
is taken among all possible ones by evaluating its number of movements,
but also taking into account that the arrangement of the
pieces to
form the second block is as favorable as possible.<br>
<br>
The search
for the second block will be done in a similar way to the first, trying
to form it completely. If this is not possible, the search will be
carried out in two steps, searching in each of them for the sub-blocks
(squares) that form the second block.<br>
<br>
The appropriate
algorithm is then found to orient the upper corners (CMLL or COLL, as
selected). These algorithms are predefined and their search is very
fast.<br>
<br>
Finally, the last six edges are solved using movements of
the U and M layers. It can be obtained in a single step (more
efficient) or can be divided into three searches (option):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
orientation of the last six edges<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
resolution of the edges in the UR and UL positions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - final
resolution.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Petrus_method">Petrus</a></h4>
The
first block is searched for each possible orientations of the cube, and
the solves are taken among all possible ones by evaluating its number
of movements, but also taking into account that the arrangement of the
pieces to expand the block is as&nbsp;favorable as possible.<br>
<br>
The search for the expanded block will be done in a similar way. Then
the edges orientation will be performed.<br>
<br>
The next step is to complete the first two layers (F2L).<br>
<br>
Finally
the last layer will be solved using ZBLL, COLL+EPLL or OCLL+PLL
algorithms. These&nbsp;algorithms are predefined and their search
is
very fast.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZZ_Method">ZZ</a></h4>
The
search starts trying to find one of this structures: EOLine, EOArrow,
EOCross, XEOLine, XEOCross and EO223. The solution is chosen for the
most complex structure, among all the possible ones, evaluating also
its number of movements and taking into account that the arrangement of
the pieces for F2L is as favorable as possible.<br>
<br>
The first two layers
(F2L) search is fast, about 2 or 3 seconds per inspection on a modern
CPU, and it will try to get the shortest possible solution for each
solve.<br>
<br>
Finally the last layer will be solved using ZBLL,
COLL+EPLL or OCLL+PLL algorithms. These algorithms are predefined and
their search is very fast.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CEOR">CEOR</a>
(YruRU)</h4>
The implementation of the CEOR-YruRU method is as explained in this <a href="https://devagio.github.io/YruRU/index.html">YruRU link</a>.<br>
<br>
As
the CP step is commonly solved in a sixth of the first line solves,
there is an
option for avoid select a CP skip solve as the most favorable.
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Mehta">Mehta</a></h4>
Mehta is a speedsolving method proposed by Yash Mehta in 2020. It relies heavily on algorithms, resulting in a method which promises a high TPS for most of the solve. It also boasts a low movecount.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Nautilus">Nautilus</a></h4>
Nautilus is a speedsolving method developed by James Straughan. It was originally developed in 2006 but was re-developed with additional variants starting in 2020.<br>
<h4><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LEOR">LEOR</a></h4>
LEOR (Left block, EOStripe, Right block) is a method which could be seen as a mix between ZZ and Roux, although due to effectively solving an EO223 in the beginning, it also shares similarities with Petrus.
<br><br>
LEOR allows for ergonomic steps while also offering a low movecount. <br>
<h3>Speed</h3>
With
this parameter you can control the amount of time necessary to get
the solves. Faster speeds get less solves than slower speeds.
Slower speeds perform deeper and more complex searches.<br>
<br>
Please note that the very slow speed can last an hour of time
or more. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There
is no cancel button, so if you want to interrupt the search, you'll
have to kill the application.</span><br>
<h3>Orientation</h3>
Choose here the cube orientation for the required solves. Selections
with many orientations (<span style="font-style: italic;">All</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">U &amp; D</span>,
etc.) requires more processing time than specific orientations (<span style="font-style: italic;">U</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">D</span>, etc.)<br>
<br>
The orientations refer to the position of the cube when you perform the
scramble.<br>
<h3>Amount of solves</h3>
Is
the number of solves that will be analyzed for each orientation. It's
possible not to reach the required number of solves, as not
all orientations provide the same amount of solves, or even
not
solves at all.<br>
<br>
Increasing the amount of solves, the search lasts more time, but can
give you more and better solves.<br><br>If you increase the amount of solves, but you don't get more solves, then you need to select a slower speed.<br>
<h3>Metric</h3>
Select here the <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Metric">metric</a>
for the solves measure.<br>
<h3>Regrips</h3>
If re-grips are enabled, rotations will be added to the solutions to get
more comfortable movements.<br>
<h3>Cancellations</h3>
If
the cancellation option is enabled, cancellation of movements will be
applied to each solution in order to get the lower metric (STM by
default). Cancellations metric will be shown surrounded by parentheses
at the beginning of each solve, near the regular metric. This
metric will be used to evaluate the best solve.<br>
<h3>Report</h3>
You can change the size of the solve report, copy, save and clear it.<br>
<h3>History</h3>
Each
time you get a search result, the report will be saved in the history,
so you can perform several searches without losing your results.<br>
