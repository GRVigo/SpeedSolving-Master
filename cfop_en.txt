CFOP method:

	The cross is searched on each of the specified orientations, with the specified
	number of moves (search depth). If this parameter is very low (less than 6) 
	solutions will hardly be found. With a value of 6 or 7, results should appear and
	with 8 it is very likely that an "XCross" will be found. The solution of the 
	cross is chosen among all the possible ones evaluating its number of movements,
	but also taking into account that the arrangement of the pieces for F2L is as
	favorable as possible.

	First two layers (F2L) search is fast, about 2 or 3 seconds per inspection on a
	modern processor, and it will try to get the shortest possible solution for each solve.

	The next step is to get the appropriate algorithms for OLL and PLL. These algorithms
	are predefined and their search is very fast. It is also possible to complete the last
	layer in a single algorithm (1LLL), or even with edges orientation and ZBLL algorithms
	(EO+ZBLL) -edges orientation search lasts a bit more time-.
