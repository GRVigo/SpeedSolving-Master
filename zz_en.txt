ZZ method

	The search starts trying to find one of this structures: EOLine, EOArrow, EOCross,
	XEOLine, XEOCross and EO223. The solution is chosen for the most complex structure,
	among all the possible ones, evaluating also its number of movements and taking into
	account that the arrangement of the pieces for F2L is as favorable as possible.

	First two layers (F2L) search is fast, about 2 or 3 seconds per inspection on a
	modern CPU, and it will try to get the shortest possible solution for each solve.

	Finally the last layer will be solved using ZBLL, COLL+EPLL or OCLL+PLL algorithms.
	These algorithms are predefined and their search is very fast.
