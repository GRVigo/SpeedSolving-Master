LBL method

	The LBL (Layer-By-Layer) method or beginners method is based on solving the layers of the cube one by
	one. The first layer is solved in two steps: first the cross, indicating the movements needed to solve each
	edge, and then the corners, one by one.

	For the second layer, the movements required to complete each of its edges are shown.

	The last layer is solved in four steps: orientation of the cross, permutation of the cross, corners
	permutation and, finally, corners orientation.

	Each step of the last layer uses only one algorithm (shown in parentheses each time it appears).
