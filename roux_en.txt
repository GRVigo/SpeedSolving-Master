Roux method

	The first block is searched for each possible orientations of the cube, using at 
	most the number of moves specified for the first block (search depth). If this 
	parameter is very low (less than 6) you will hardly find solutions. With a value 
	of 6 or 7, results should already appear, and with 8, a result should appear for 
	each orientation. The solution for the first block is taken among all possible ones
	by evaluating its number of movements, but also taking into account that the 
	arrangement of the pieces to form the second block is as favorable as possible.

	The search for the second block will be done in a similar way to the first, trying
	to form it completely. If this is not possible, the search will be carried out in two
	steps, searching in each of them for the sub-blocks (squares) that form the second 
	block. You can specify his own search depth.

	The appropriate algorithm is then found to orient the upper corners (CMLL or COLL, as
	selected). These algorithms are predefined and their search is very fast.

	Finally, the last six edges are solved using movements of the U and M layers. It can be
	obtained in a single step (more efficient) or can be divided into three searches:
		- orientation of the last six edges
		- resolution of the edges in the UR and UL positions
		- final resolution.
